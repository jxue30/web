   <h2>
		What Happens During Sleep
   </h2>
   <p>
		Researchers do not completely understand what happens during sleep yet,
		but so far, they have broken it up into four stages. The first stage is
		N1, and it usually only lasts one to five minutes. It's what we associate
		with dozing off, and someone can be easily awaken from this stage. The next
		stage is N2, and heart rate and breathing slows down. This stage usually
		lasts 10-25 minutes. The next stage, which is also the most important one,
		is N3. Heart rate and breathing slows down further, and the body relaxes
		and heals. This stage is linked to creativity, memory, and problem solving
		abilities. N3 usually lasts 20-40 minutes.
		The last stage is REM, which stands for Rapid Eye Movement. During this stage,
		the entire body is paralyzed except for the muscles that control eye movement
		and breathing. This stage can be from 10 to 60 minutes long, and brain activity
		speeds up.
		As the night progresses, each stage in the sleep cycle tends to lengthen.
		An average person goes through four to six cycles per night.

   <h2>
		Effects of Sleep Deprivation
   </h2>
   <p>
		Sleep deprivation can have deprecating effects on the body. It 
		can result in changes in energy levels, mood, focus, and memory.
		Sleep deprivation also weakens the immune system, and chronic sleep deprivation
		increases the risk for stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and mental
		illnesses such as depression and anxiety. It can also cause weight gain since
		being sleep-deprived increases apatite and decreases metabolism.
		Sleep deprivation also speeds up aging and shortens
		life expectancy. Sleep deprivation can be caused by insomnia or other sleep
		disorders, schedules, and using electronics before bedtime.

   <h2>
		Sleeping Habits
   </h2>
   <p>
		There are many ways to fall asleep quicker and increase your quality of sleep.
		One is to reduce blue light exposure in the evenings. Some devices have settings
		to block blue light, and reducing screen time is another way to reduce exposure.
		Establishing a bedtime routine is also helpful, along with waking up and sleeping
		at the same times each day. Calming down before sleeping and doing something
		relaxing such as reading a book also might help you fall asleep faster, and
		some people use breathing exercises. Also, studies have shown that exercising
		during the day, for as little as just 30 minutes, can also improve sleep.
